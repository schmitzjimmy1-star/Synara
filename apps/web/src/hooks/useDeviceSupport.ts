// Exports: useDeviceSupport
// Depends on: server environment query

/**
 * The simulator engine lives in apps/server and shells out to the user's Xcode,
 * so support follows the *server's* platform, not the browser's. A Mac browser
 * pointed at a Linux server has no simulators, and a Windows browser pointed at
 * a Mac server does. Until the environment resolves this is false, which keeps
 * the add-menu entry from flickering in and out on a cold start.
